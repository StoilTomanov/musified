## Getting started

### Instalation

1. Install all dependancies required for the application to work using `npm install` in the command panel

2. Install all dependancies required for the REST server to work again using `npm install` in the command panel. Note: REST server is in a separate folder which means you will first need to naviagte to this folder

3. Ensure you are using your correct MongoDb connection string. You can check `index.js` file for that.

4. While you are in the REST server folder run `npm run start` in the command panel. This will start the server on port 4000

5. Navigate to the Musified application folder and run `ng serve`. Once done the app should be running properly on `http://localhost:4200`

## About project

- Musified is educational online platform that allows users to enroll for any course uploaded in the platform. Courses are music related and are all for free ðŸ™‚
- Once you created an account you will be able to explore and enroll for a new course. From there you will find all your courses in the `My Courses` section from where you can play them, rate them, take a quiz and more. Once course is considered completed once the video materials have been played as well the quiz is taken with at least 80% correct answers. In case your score is lower you can re-watch or re-take the quiz as many time you need. Enjoy and let the music be with you!
