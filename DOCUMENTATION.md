## Getting started

### Instalation

1. Install all dependancies required for the application to work using `npm install` in the command panel

2. Install all dependancies required for the REST server to work again using `npm install` in the command panel. Note: REST server is in a separate folder which means you will first need to naviagte to this folder

3. Ensure you are using your correct MongoDb connection string. You can check `index.js` file for that.

4. While you are in the REST server folder run `npm run start` in the command panel. This will start the server on port 4000

5. Navigate to the Musified application folder and run `ng serve`. Once done the app should be running properly on `http://localhost:4200`
